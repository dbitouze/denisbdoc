denisbdoc - A personal package for documenting classes and packages, v. 0.6
===========================================================================

**The (quick 'n dirty) `denisbdoc` package is just for documenting the classes
I've written.**

The class is supplied in `.dtx` format. If you want to unpack the `.dtx`
yourself, running:

     tex denisbdoc.dtx

will extract the package.

This package is currently not documented.
